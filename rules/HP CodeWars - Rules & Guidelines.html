<p><b>Student Eligibility</b>
	<ul>
		<li>HP CodeWars is open to students in grades 9-12 at public or private high schools, or of equivalent age (for home schooled students)
	</ul>
</p><p><b>Equipment</b></p>
   <ul>
     <li> Each team is allowed use of one, and only one, computer during the competition (i.e. one computer, one keyboard).  No virtual machines, etc.
     <li> Printers are not allowed.
     <li> Very large monitors are discouraged (due to power consumption)
     <li> <font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE</b></font> -- Cell phones and broadband network cards are NOT allowed during CodeWars competition.&nbsp; If you are observed using either of these during the CodeWars competition, your team is subject to <font color="#FF0000">immediate disqualification</font>.&nbsp; If you may need to be contacted via cell phone during the competition, your phone should be left with your team sponsor.
    </ul>
</p></b>

<p><b>Development Software</b>
<p>Development software allowed for competition:
	<ul>
		<li>Java (Java 7u51 or later). 
	    <li>Python (version 3.4 or later (Python 3), or version 2.7 or later (Python 2).
		<li>C/C++/C#.  You need an ANSI-compatible C/C++/C# compiler that can create a self-contained Windows command-line executable
		<li>JavaScript.  We support programs written in JavaScript using the RingoJS runtime. The current version is 0.11. More information on working with RingoJS is available via the Downloads page.
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b>General Format</b></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both the Novice and Advanced teams will share a common pool of approximately 20 problems.</li>
		<li>Each problem carries a point value, with values increasing with problem difficulty.</li> 
		<li>The goal is to solve as many problems as possible in 3 hours. At the end, the teams
			with the most points win!</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Competition Rules / Guidelines</b></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The judges' rulings are final.</li>
		<li>The judges' rulings are <b>final</b>.</li> 
		<li>All solutions must programmatically determine the results. In other words, your
			solution cannot just print out a solution to a problem that you determined by hand.
			The judges will be using some different data sets for your programs at the judging
			table.</li>
		
		
		<li>File naming conventions for solutions must be followed.</li>
		
		<li>Your team will have a number programming tasks to choose from. You probably will not be able to solve them all, so you are advised to study them and choose your problems wisely.</li>
		<li>HP CodeWars utilizes a custom browser-based submission/judging/scoring system via an 802.11x wireless network. Please ensure that your computer is wireless-capable before the event day.  If you can connect to a public wireless network (e.g. the public library or Panera) and browse the Internet, you should be in good shape.  Some school computers have security lockdowns that prevent wireless configuration, so please verify this before you come.</li>
		<li>Each team will receive a unique team login and password for the competition.</li>
		<li>Programs must be a standard DOS or Windows console application. No GUI programs.</li>
		<li>There is no limit to the number of submissions you can make to solve a given problem.  However, note that in the case
of a tie score, the winners will be determined by the fewest incorrect submissions.</li>
<li>Any necessary corrections to contest problems will be displayed to all competitors on your team page in the contest system, and announced in the contest room(s).</li>
<li>Verify that your program works with the example input before submitting it to the judges. Don't waste your time (and the judges') submitting a bad program you could have caught with your
			own testing.</li>
<li>Additional rules, modifications, and more details will be made available to you on the day
	of the event.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><b>Novice or Advanced?</b></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>We are often asked, "Should we compete in the Novice or Advanced division?"  There are no hard-and-fast rules dividing Novice teams from Advanced teams.  Teams that are relatively new to programming and/or competition should likely choose Novice.  Teams that regularly participate in competitions and have experienced programmers should think about Advanced.  The goal is to maximize each team's chances to win something.</li>
	</ul>
